#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// C++ IS A MULTI-PARADIGM LANGUAGE. THAT MEANS IT CAN BE USEFUL FOR BOTH FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
//      AND OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING.

// C++ IS CASE SENSITIVE LANGUAGE.
// C++ IS STATISTICALLY TYPED LANGUAGE.

// DATA TYPES :- A DATA TYPE IS SIMPLY A CLASSIFICATION OF DATA WE INTENDED TO USE
// IT CARRIES OUT 2 DIFFERENT WORK.
//      1) TO TELL A VARIABLE WHAT TYPE OF DATA IT IS GOIN TO STORE.
//      2) TO TELL THE COMPILER HOW MUCH SPACE/SIZE TO BE ALLOCATED.

//                                      DATA TYPES
//            PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE                        NON-PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE
//               * INTEGER (int)                            /               \
//               * CHARACTER (char)                DERIVED DATA TYPE        USER DEFINDED
//               * BOOLEAN (bool)                   * ARRAYS                  * CLASS
//               * FLOATING POINT (float)           * FUNCTIONS               * STRUCTURE
//               * DOUBLE FLOATING POINT (double)   * POINTERS                * UNION
//                                                                            * ENUMERATION

//  ALL THINGS MENTIONED ABOVE INSIDE () ARE KEYWORDS USE TO CREATE A VARIABLE OF THAT DATA TYPE.

//  sizeof() -- IT IS SPECIAL OPERATOR IN C++ WHICH TELLS US HOW MUCH MEMORY HAS BEEN OCCUPIED BY A VARIABLE.
//  FOR EXAMPLE --- sizeof(int) <---- will give me output as 4 (4 bytes)
//                  sizeof(double) <---- will give me output as 8 (8 bytes)

//  STATISTICALLY TYPED LANGUAGE & DYNAMICALLY TYPED LANGUAGE -- THE BASIC UNDERSTANDING
//          In Statically typed language data type of variable's are static, meaning once you set a variable to a type, you cannot change it.
//              FOR EXAMPLE - string var_name = "Hello";
//                             ...
//                             ...
//                             ...
//                             var_name = 5     <---- This will generate an error in statistically type language like C++.

//          In Dynamically typed language variables' types are dynamic, meaning after you set a variable to a type, you CAN change it.
//              FOR EXAMPLE - var name = "Hello";
//                             ...
//                             ...
//                             name = 5         <--- Perfectly alright in langauge like JavaScript
//
//          The main advantage with statistically typed language is that all kinds of checking can be done by the compiler, and therefore a lot of trivial bugs are caught at a very early stage.
